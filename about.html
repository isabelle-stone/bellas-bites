                    <p>Welcome to Bella's Bites! This café was born from a journey many find themselves on – finding out the devastating news that you're allergic to gluten. Gluten, of all things. Oh, and don't even get me started on dairy. Imagine being allergic to both gluten <em>and</em> dairy. Not being able to enjoy life's most treasured gifts like a grilled cheese or pizza.</p>
                    <p>"What even is gluten?" many have asked, and nobody seems to have an answer. But what we do know is that gluten attacks too many of our strongest soldiers' intestines. They struggle to find delicious, satisfying meals that don't compromise on taste or texture. What started as experimenting in her own kitchen quickly became a passion for creating plant-based, gluten-free dishes that everyone could enjoy.</p>

                    <p>We believe that dietary restrictions shouldn't mean sacrificing flavor or the joy of sharing a meal with loved ones. Every recipe at Bella's Bites is crafted with love, using fresh, organic, locally-sourced ingredients that celebrate the natural flavors of whole foods.</p>
                    <p>Today, Bella's Bites is more than just a cafe—it's a community space where everyone, regardless of dietary needs, can gather and enjoy nourishing, delicious food together. We're proud to serve meals that are kind to your body, the planet, and all living beings.</p>
